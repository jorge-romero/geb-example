# Testing with Geb

In this repository you'll find some little examples of using [Geb](http://gebish.org) to test an example React application.  

The app is based in the one created by [Teambit](https://github.com/teambit/react-demo-app) with some modifications to be able to test it properly with geb adding some *ids* to make easy to retrive elements on the page.  
You'll find 2 projects:
* react-app: The react app that you can run with ```npm start```
* geb-app: That is handle by gradle, so you can easily run test with *Chrome*
